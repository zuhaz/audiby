# Audiby 
Versatile Modern (*maybe*) Audiobook Player
(Under development (cuz me lazy :D))

# TODO: Current Goal:
- [ ] Add **Library Page** *can either add files/folders to it manually or set it to a specific folder where it recognizes folders and files itself*
- [ ] **Add Search bar**
- [ ] **Make a super clean library page**
- [ ] **Now playing page** *it has a previously set background wallpaper of the book playing and over it is slightly transparent Ui of a progress bar on a black rounded edges rectangle..another block this one vertical to show chapters..the middle one is lit up with accent colors and some sound wave animations infront of it..above it is previous chapter and below it is one chapter that comes afterwards..can scroll up and down too to see more..another block that pops up on right clicking bookmark icon and shows bookmarks*

# TODO: Potential Features:

- [ ] Add a **Sleep Timer** *sleep timer should be adjustable..you can either select hours and minutes..or for player to close after (x) number of chapters or after current book finishes..sleep timer doesn't necessarily mean for system to shutdown..it can either sleep or just close the book player..10 mins are added if a movement is detected in the last 10 mins*
- [ ] Add ability to *View chapters in a book and click on any one of them to play from that*
- [ ] Add **bookmarks** *and can name bookmarks..give them custom colors and can click on them to move to that timeframe in the book*
- [ ] Add a **favorites section**
- [ ] Add a **most read/listened to** section
- [ ] Add **ability to sort** *by genre, by author, and by series*
- [ ] Add **time spent** *on a particular book and also be able to see time spent on a whole series*
- [ ] Add *reading pdf functionality** or *epub reading*
- [ ] Add **infinite scrolling** *but optimize it..maybe instead of loading the whole book at once we can decide to load (x) number of pages up and down at a time..like minecraft how the chunks load and then disappear as we traverse..this can end of looking like infinite scroll without the weight it can bring for stuff like reverend insanity pdf*
- [ ] Add **horizontal smooth circular blocks carousel** *for scrolling between series, books of a singular series and there is a shift in the theme with each scroll between two book series..if set up the barely visible background image will change for each series..if no background image is setup only accent colors will change and background will be a solid black or just a regular spectrum or somethin*
- [ ] Add a **Your history** page *it shows which books you left and where you left them...clicking on them resumes where you left them..if you're listening to a audiobook..say "How to moan like a femboy definitive edition" and sleep timer closes the player after some time..when you open the player again this book will be displayer infront of you and will also indicate where you left it and you can click to get back to your lessons..you won't have to go to the "History page" for it..you only need to do that for more options*
- [ ] **Highlight now playing bar** *when sleep timer is set to x hours and y minutes..then program estimates that and adds that amount of time to the time when sleep timer can set on and then highlights the audiobar blue or somethin so we can visually see at which point will the player stop..after we reopen player we can still see it but it'll be in a different color...say red..you can make it disappear too but it helps you estimate at which point you slept and where you should pick back up from*
- [ ] **Give stars to each book**
- [ ] **Good UI and can add custom images for book covers or background**
- [ ] **Control scroll speed**
- [ ] **Add pdf viewing style** *people who like reading it in double page form like a read book can read like that and there will be a page flipping animation when > arrow key is pressed*
- [ ] **Make pdf text white and background black** *can be customized but you can't simply invert colors since some books have artworks in between pages that can get fucked up with this or maps of the world*
- [ ] **Ability to download audiobooks or pdfs** (weak, might not add   )
- [ ] **Ability to leave notes** *leaves your notes on each chapter or on each book as a whole to recall your emotions at that time*
- [ ] **Volume Control**
- [ ] **Equalizer**
- [ ] **Read speed modification**
- [ ] **Auto rewind on pause** *5 seconds is the default but can be set up differently in settings and if more than 5 minutes have passed since last pause then unpausing will play from 30 secs before*
- [ ] **Skip back and forth** *skip forward or backwords with arrow keys or by pressing buttons on screen..skips should be adjustable..default is 15 seconds*
- [ ] **AI Voiceover** (Heavy lifting needed)
- [ ] **Text to speech** *for the visually impaired* (heavy lifting needed)
- [ ] **Button to pull up pdf of book** *if pdf of book has been added already and linked with its audiobook form then pressing a button will pull it up in the chapter that's currently playing so user can verify some spellings*
- [ ] **One drive and google drive integration** (or just ability to download via supported providers: drive, internet archive, etc)
- [ ] **Slow face out after sleep timer ends** *audio does not stop abruptly but fadse out so it seems natural*
- [ ] **Add a plan to read section** *can number books too in order we plan to read*
- [ ] **goodreads integration**
- [ ] **Clip audio bookmarks** *some particularly menacing lines/quotes or fight scenes can be clipped as bookmarks and named too*
- [ ] **Book Queue Option**
- [ ] **Tagging** *Needs to support tagging that can show Series and Sequence in Series    e.g Series - Lord of the Rings Sequence - Book 2 of 3*
- [ ] **Separate progress bars for each chapter of a book too**
- [ ] The playback speed control should be in increments of 0.01x so it can be more finetuned
